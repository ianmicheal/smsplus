What's new since Dreamcast 0.1 release :
- screen adjust display current game texture
- single game emu : auto load the game call boot.gg or boot.sms on the root
- try to do a screenshot slideshow, but too cd lens intensive
- 3d glasses faking support

Huge thanks goes to 
Gentil Graphiste for his really nice gui design,
Charles Mac Donald for this amazing emu,
Takayama Fumihiko for the VMU code and off course Dan Potter for making this possible.

if i forgot anyone, it's not intend
